## Features

### User Features:
1. **Home Page:**
   - Three pricing plans with details such as:
     - Plan name (e.g., Basic, Pro, Business).
     - Price per month.
     - Features included in each plan.
     - "Sign Up" button for each plan.
   - Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
   - Hover effects for interactive pricing cards.

2. **Pricing Plans:**
   - Each pricing card contains:
     - Plan title.
     - Monthly cost.

     - CTA (Call-to-action) button to sign up.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - Fully responsive across various devices like mobile, tablet, and desktop.
   - Organized layout that adjusts based on screen size for optimal user experience.

4. **Simple and Clean Design:**
   - Minimalistic UI with focus on clear typography and easy-to-understand pricing details.
   - Suitable for displaying service tiers or subscription models.

### Navigation Bar:
- Simple navigation without complex menus.
- Links to additional sections such as Sign Up and other calls to action (depending on future expansion).

### Admin Features:
